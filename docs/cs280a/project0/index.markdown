# CS280A: Project 0 
## Part 1: Selfie: The wrong way vs. the right way

<figure class="side-by-side">
  <img src="/assets/images/project0/P1_1.jpeg" alt="ZG close">
  <img src="/assets/images/project0/P1_2.jpeg" alt="ZG far zoom in.">
  <figcaption>Figure 1: Left: Close up photo of my partner. Right: Stepping back and zooming in. I did get consent to take her photo (although she doesn't like either too much...oops)</figcaption>
</figure>

## Part 2: Architectural Perspective Compression

<figure class="side-by-side">
  <img src="/assets/images/project0/P2_2.jpeg" alt="Building far with zoom in">
  <img src="/assets/images/project0/P2_1.jpeg" alt="Building close">
  <figcaption>Figure 2: A office building near Berkeley Marina. Left: Far away photo with zoom-in.. Right: Getting closer and taking a photo with less zoom. The left one is a bit more pixelated.</figcaption>

## Part 3: The Dolly Zoom

<figure class="side-by-side">
  <img src="/assets/images/project0/hallway_v2.gif" alt="Hallway zoom">
  <figcaption>Figure 3: Dolly zoom of a building hallway. It's a bit jittery because I found it hard to keep the exact same angle while backing up...and I found it hard to take the shot unless there was a clear reference point to try to keep the same size (e.g. the doorway).</figcaption>
